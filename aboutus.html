      <h1>Why We Exist</h1>

      <p>
	  How many times have you heard about one of your favorite musicians playing a show in your town, after they’ve already played it? I’m sure you can remember many times that you have felt the disappoint that comes along with the realization that you’ve missed out. By using LocalShows.com, you can ensure that you never feel that disappointment again. Not only will you never forget or miss your favorite artists shows around you, but you will also be able to discover new music in your area.           
	 <br><br>
	  </p>
	        <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <br>
      <p>
	  
	For music lovers, LocalShows.com will be a free service. For small music venues, LocalShows.com will offer a few options for pricing. The first option is a price-per-show option. Music venues can choose to pay $1.00 per show listing that they post on LocalShows.com. This will be attractive to venues that offer a variety of events, which aren’t used to marketing to music lovers and are looking to advertise a concert. The second option would be a pay-per-show listing with the option to buy tickets online through LocalShows.com. The price for this will be $1.25, costing the venue $0.25 for each ticket sold through LocalShows.com. The target market for this pricing option would be similar to the target market of option one, but more specifically venues that are not equipped to sell their tickets online. The third and final pricing option for LocalShows.com will be a subscription. For $10.00 a month, a music venue will be allowed to post as many shows as they wish, and the option to sell tickets through LocalShows.com will be included.  
<br><br>
As far as expenses go, the costs to run LocalShows.com will be very low. Because of that low cost, the profit margin for any of our pricing options will be relatively high. Obviously, the profit margins for option one and two will be higher than the third option, because of the discounted price per show of the subscription. When successful, music venues will return to LocalShows.com and continue to advertise their show schedule through our service.
